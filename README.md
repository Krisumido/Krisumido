 - On GitHub classes, updates on my repository and profile.
## 💞️ For now I'm able to collaborate on...
 - Portuguese-English translation or vice-versa
 - Elementary manipulation with Python
## 📫 YOU CAN reach me on ...
 - Linkedin Kristhyan Rodrigues - where I'm trying to share some conclusion about what I'd learned.
 - Instagram @krisumido - where I show a few moments of study, and I'm more use to comment my learning.
