 # What's up guys!

  My name Is Kristhyan,

  ##  My bases of interests are...
- Behavior, Management and Automation
##  I’m currently learning
 - Fundamentals of Development(GitHub at the moment) and Python(with purpose on Data Science).
 - In py, a base module working with: the elementary manipulation of dirs, notes, pdf and excel schedules.
 - On GitHub classes, updates on my repository and profile.
##  For now I'm able to collaborate on
 - Portuguese-English translation or vice-versa
 - Elementary manipulation with Python
 - ⚠ But call me if you like it... "two heads think better than one" 
##  YOU CAN reach me on 
 - Linkedin Kristhyan Rodrigues - where I'm trying to share some conclusion about what I'd learned.
 - Instagram @krisumido - where I show a few moments of study, and I'm more use to comment my learning.
 - Email kristhyan.claro@outlook.com
 - OR HERE  GitHub @Krisumido

### I hope, more than ALL, to learn how share what I have learned.
