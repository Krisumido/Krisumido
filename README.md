  ##  My bases of interests are...
- Behavior, Management and Automation
##  I’m currently learning
 - Fundamentals of Development(GitHub at the moment) and Python(with purpose on Data Science).
 - In py, now on the module of: data analysis and treatment of data.
    applying on the project that has personal data of my current job.
 
 - On GitHub classes, updates on my repository and profile.


##  YOU CAN reach me on 
 - Linkedin Kristhyan Rodrigues - where I'm trying to share some conclusions and insights over what I'd learned and live.
 - Instagram @krisumido - where I show a few moments of study, and I'm more use to commenting my learning path.
 - Email kristhyan.claro@outlook.com

### I hope, more than ALL, to learn how share what I have learned.
